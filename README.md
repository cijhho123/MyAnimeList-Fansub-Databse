# MyAnimeList Fansub Databse
An archive of the Anime Fansub databse from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), which was removed from the site in 2018.

# Why To Use?
I think that MAL/JustAnotherShiro summarized is pretty good:  
> Fansubs section removed? Now that's huge loss. Much bigger than API or clubs imo. Downloading first episode from multiple groups and comparing them myself is huge pain.

You can use this extensive database to find the best fansub suitted for you for anime up untill 2018. All according to keikaku.  
**Translator's note:** keikaku means plan.
